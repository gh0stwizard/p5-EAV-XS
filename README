NAME
    EAV::XS - Email Address Validator

SYNOPSIS
        use EAV::XS;

        my $eav = EAV::XS->new();

        if ($eav->is_email ('valid@example.com')) {
            print "This is a valid email address.\n";
        } else {
            printf "The email address is not valid: %s\n",

DESCRIPTION
    The purpose of this module is a validation of the specified Email
    Address <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address>.

    The core part of the module is written in C and can be found here
    <https://github.com/gh0stwizard/libeav>.

    At the moment this module conforms to RFC 6531
    <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6531> and RFC 20
    <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc20>. This means that the module supports
    Internationalized Email Addresses encoded in UTF-8, RFC 3629
    <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3629>.

    The default behavior of the module also includes the check of:

    *   Special and Reserved domains as mentioned in RFC 6761
        <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6761>

    *   FQDN - if the domain contains only alias and it is not a special or
        reserved domain, then the result is negative, that is, such an email
        address is considered as invalid.
