NAME
    EAV::XS - Email Address Validator

SYNOPSIS
        use EAV::XS;

        my $eav = EAV::XS->new();

        if ($eav->is_email ('valid@example.com')) {
            print "This is a valid email address.\n";
        } else {
            printf "The email address is not valid: %s\n",
                    $eav->get_error();
        }

DESCRIPTION
    The purpose of this module is a validation of the specified Email
    Address <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address>.

    The core part of the module is written in C and can be found here
    <https://github.com/gh0stwizard/libeav>.

    The module conforms to:

    *   RFC 822 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc822> - allows control
        characters.

    *   RFC 5321 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5321> - does not allow any
        control characters.

    *   RFC 5322 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322> - allows some control
        characters and not allows SPACE and TAB characters without
        quoted-pairs.

    *   RFC 6531 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6531> and RFC 20
        <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc20>. Allows Internationalized Email
        Addresses encoded in UTF-8, RFC 3629
        <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3629>.

        Currently, this mode based on RFC 5321 and disallow next characters,
        as described in RFC 20: "`", "#", "^", "{", "}", "~" and "|". They
        must be in double-quotes.

    *   Special and Reserved domains as mentioned in RFC 6761
        <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6761>

    *   FQDN - if the domain contains only alias and it is not a special or
        reserved domain, then the result is negative, that is, such an email
        address is considered as invalid.

DEPENDENCIES
    This module depends on libidnkit <https://jprs.co.jp/idn/index-e.html>.
    You have to install it before using this module.

METHODS
    *   $eav = new ( [%options] )

        Creates a new EAV::XS object, if something goes wrong a message will
        be thrown via croak().

        Possible options includes:

        *   rfc - use this RFC specification. Possible values are: *RFC822*,
            *RFC5321*, *RFC5322* or *RFC6531*. Default is *RFC6531*.

        *   tld_check - enable or disable TLD check. Also, this controls
            FQDN check. Enabled by default.

        *   allow_tld - list of TLD types which considered be good. You have
            to specify this list via logical OR ("|"). Information about
            possible values described below in section "TLD INFORMATION".

            Default value is: *TLD_COUNTRY_CODE* | *TLD_GENERIC* |
            *TLD_GENERIC_RESTRICTED* | *TLD_INFRASTRUCTURE* |
            *TLD_SPONSORED* | *TLD_SPECIAL*.

    *   $yes_no = is_email ( $email )

        Validates the specified email. Returns true if the email is valid,
        otherwise returns false.

    *   $error_message = get_error ()

        Returns an error message for the last email address tested by
        is_email() method.

  TLD INFORMATION
    The current list of all TLDs can be found on IANA Root Zone Database
    <https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db> website.

    The allow_tld option accepts the next values:

    *   TLD_NOT_ASSIGNED - allow not assigned TLDs. On IANA website they are
        listed as "Not assigned" in the "Sponsoring Organisation" field.

    *   TLD_COUNTRY_CODE - allow county-code TLDs.

    *   TLD_GENERIC - allow generic TLDs.

    *   TLD_GENERIC_RESTRICTED - allow generic-restricted TLDs.

    *   TLD_INFRASTRUCTURE - allow infrastructure TLDs.

    *   TLD_SPONSORED - allow sponsored TLDs.

    *   TLD_TEST - allow test TLDs.

    *   TLD_SPECIAL - allow Special & Restricted TLDs. See RFC 2606
        <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2606>, RFC 6761
        <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6761> and RFC 7686
        <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7686> for details.

        Currently, this includes the next TLDs: "test.", "invalid.",
        "localhost.", "example.", "onion." and also Second Level Domains,

    For instance, to allow only country-code and generic TLDs you have to
    write this:

        my $eav = EAX::XS->new(
            allow_tld => EAV::XS::TLD_COUNTRY_CODE | EAV::XS::TLD_GENERIC
        );

        if (not $eav->is_email ('test@example.biz')) {
            print ".biz is generic-restricted TLD and not allowed.\n";
        }
